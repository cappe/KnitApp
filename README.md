# KnitApp
My girlfriend knits a lot but she designs her knitting patterns on a piece of paper. Sometimes complex designs require a lot of drawing and erasing which can make the designing quite annoying. In addition, it can be frustrating to carry all the sketches and pencils along when travelling.

This web app aims to ease the designing process by providing a platform with the same kind of work flow but with the following features:

* Sketches can be saved in the cloud
* Sketches can be modified at any time
* Sketches can be private or public
* Sketches can be shared with other users
